symbreg.py

GENERAL
- The symbreg.py script draws on DEAP example scripts 

https://github.com/DEAP/deap/blob/master/examples/gp/symbreg.py

and is modified slightly to meet the requirements of the AIML426 project 1 Question 3.  The script has no input requirements, all primitives and terminal sets are hardcoded to the script.  Most standard mathematical operations are included.  Additional safe division and _if_then_else_ functions are also included.  

The programme attempts to develop a single formula for potential solutions to a piecewise problem.  

f(x) = 1/x +sinx, for x>0 ; 2x+x**2 + 3.0, for x <= 0


INSTALL

The script is assumed to be in the working directory, although it can be installed from github:

https://github.com/ctkakau/AIML426A1/blob/main/symbreg.py


USAGE

The script takes as arguments:
INPUT requirements
seed: numeric, used as random seed for replicability

RETURNS
three objects: 
pop: list object containing all individuals in the population, for each generation

logbook: list of dictionaries containing statistics for each generation, includes: generation number, maximum fitness for the generation, number of evaluations

EXECUTION

The script can be run directly.  An RMD file is also available that executes the script and reports the results

https://github.com/ctkakau/AIML426A1/blob/main/AIML426P1Q3.Rmd

The RMD runs the algorithms three times and reports the evolved programmes as trees.  

REQUIREMENTS
The script has no specific requirements

A renv file is available that provides information on relevant packages and libraries:
