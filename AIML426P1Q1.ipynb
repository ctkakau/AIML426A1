Each bit represented an individual item, with 0 indicating the item is excluded the knapsack and 1 indicating the item is included in the knapsack.  For me, this made a better logical representation of the individual in relation to the problem - do I carry an item or not.  I considered retaining the approach used in the example - a 'set' of integer values representing the index of each item to be carried in the knapsack - while that made sense in terms of the python object, I preferred the in-out representation of the N-bit binary list."

So if an individual includes a particular item, the item's indicator = 1 and the item's 'value' and 'weight' will be added to the total.  If the item's indicator is 0, then the 'value' and 'weight' will also multiply to zero, and not be added to the total.  \n",

Each instance of the Individual class, drew a random binary value, N-times.  Each population comprised the desired number of instantiated individuals, with the initial population being 5*N (where N is the number of items) and the second and subsequent generations being twice this size.\n",

    "Because the third knapsack problem had many high-weight items, I included a heavy bias towards generating an initial population of individuals that had very few items present.  I set a proportion of 9:1 that an item would be excluded, so individuals in the first population had mostly empty knapsacks (i.e. 90 of 100 items would be excluded from the knapsack).  Without this bias, the population and each subsequent evolution quickly saturated with invalid individuals and it was almost impossible for valid individuals to develop once that occurred.  This bias had no visible impact on the other two knapsack problems, which both achieved close to optimal results regardless of the make up of the first generation of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allowed for creation of individual's according to a parameter (N = total number of items), providing flexibility for responding to a range of different-sized item lists and knapsack limits, albeit defined by the layout of provided data."

    "My algorithm selection (eaMuPlusLambda) was driven mostly by the third knapsack problem.  While the first two knapsacks would reach convergence with most algorithms, the third knapsack problem became saturated with invalid individuals almost from the outset when using eaMuCommaLambda, where the next generation is selected __only__ from the children produced by the VarOr function (i.e. results of crossover, or mutation, or remaining parent individuals).  Thus, the next generation has a lower proportion of mostly-empty knapsacks than a generation selected (as in eaMuPlusLambda) from both the parent (which has a high proportion of mostly-empty knapsacks) __and__ the offspring which should also have a high proportion of mostly empty knapsacks (i.e. only the mutated individuals should have additional items included).

I preferred crossover (CXPB = 0.6) over mutation (MUTPB = 0.4), primarily as a result of tuning for the third knapsack problem that a high proportion of high-weight items and was only successful after evolving from initial populations of mostly empty knapsacks.  When performing either Uniform cross-over or FlipBit mutation, I set the probability at 0.4 for each gene (thus, 40% of the genes in an pair selected for crossover would be swapped and 40% of the genes in an individual selected for mutation would be flipped).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most parameters were selected based on their impact on the third knapsack problem, which started with mostly-empty knapsacks.  The main strategy was to limit the quantity of items in any individual so after starting with a population of mostly-empty knapsacks, I was more interested in moving few items between individuals (i.e. crossover) than in having mostly-empty knapsacks have more items added (i.e. mutating), so I had a higher crossover than mutation rate.  Similarly, the relatively low probability of an individual gene being selected for crossover or mutation (0.4) was chosen to slow the rate that mostly-empty knapsacks fill with new items, while still allowing convergence to close to optimal levels, and this convergence was present across all three knapsack problems."

    "\n",
    "Based on testing during development, these modifications are not expected to have signficant impact on the results of the 10 and 23 item knapsack problems.  I expect worse performance for both modifications on the 100 item knapsack problem, as the increased number of items present in each individual, also increases the likelihood that over-weight, invalid individuals saturate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across the three modified experiments, the results are consistent for the 10 item and 23 item knapsack problems, i.e. convergence is reached fairly quickly and the optimum value is achieved for both knapsacks, with all modifications to the generational algorithm.  For the 100 item knapsack problem, there is variation between the modified experiments, although this level of variation was also observed during testing when running the same experiment, so it is unclear if the variation is a result of the modifications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I expected lower performance when using the eaMuCommaLambda algorithm as new individual's are only selected from the crossed and mutated offspring, which increases the effect of mutation (i.e. since the majority of chromosomes are 0 in the early generations, then the number of items added to individuals in subsequent generations increases earlier).  Based on the plotted results for the 100 item knapsack, the eaMuCommaLamba algorithm took slightly longer to begin generating better performing individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "I also expected lower performance when increasing the number of items initialising in early individual knapsacks.  Because the 100 item knapsack problem has many high-weighted items, it was difficult during early development for the algorithm to recover from populations with individuals that had a high number of items.  The algorithm with more items performed better than I expected (based on my development and testing), the algorithm produced better solutions earlier than the original and the eaMuCommaLambda versions, presumably as a result of the greater probability of having knapsacks with items, and therefore value, generated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence for the 100 item knapsack was slower across all variations (original, eaMuCommaLambda, more_items) than for the other two knapsack problems, and in most runs, convergence wasn't obviously achieved.  Potentially, a greater number of generations may have achieved convergence for the 100 item knapsack problem."

    "\n",
    "The change in algorithm (from eaMuPlusLambda to eaMuCommaLambda) had little effect on the overall performance.  The increase in items within the initial individuals also had a surprisingly small effect.  And that's when it hit me.  When I was initially developing my algorithm, the 100 item knapsack was routinely saturated with invalid individuals.  I managed to finally get some useful results when I increased the likelihood of empty knapsacks for the initial population, and that intervention stuck in my head as the silver bullet.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But what I did in subsequent testing and tweaking was to reduce the ratio of mutation to crossover (mostly crossover) and the likelihood of mutation or crossover on a single chromosome (to 0.4), so the rate of evolution was fairly slow, but always towards optimal knapsacks. "
